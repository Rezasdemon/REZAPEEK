//################ INTRODUCTIONS
Im Reza, 22, self taught programmer.

Donations highly appreciated and will go 100% to developing the app.
Rezasdemon@gmail.com -> paypal.com;

I will try to keep it open source but once I get to memory editing
the source will be only partially uploaded I'm building a framework
for handling the menus and general display and data type handling
once that is finished I'll be writing the memory editor. The 
memory class will be written in a seperate file which wont be 
uploaded the current source will work however and feel free to 
make your own apps using my framework. Its not much yet but I am
working every day on it.

//################ PRE NOTE / Credits

Use of code from 
rincheat
gohanmem 

The code here is far from complete but shows my ideas for this.
I took some code from rincheat, but its mainly just the main class
structure and the blit framework  ,100% his thread pause method.
if you compare them they are very different
in my main class I removed everything and just made it a wrapper 
to call my ui class. if you look at ui class you will see 
I tested dynamic loading from structs, and I plan to extend structs
to everything. I can re-factor alot but this is a good solid starting 
point for a base framework.

This is my first time coding in C and on embedded systems. esp 
thru a rigged sdk like this so bare with me I'm having a language 
barrier. I hope to bring the experience from other languages to
this project.

//################ INSTALLATION
App Is not in a working state for cheating memory once that
point is reached I will release compiled versions as well
for normal users. For advanced users that wanna play with it

1. edit makefile for ftp upload
1. using sdk
2. make clean
3. make
4. make send

manual install goes to ux0:/plugins/rezapeek.suprx

Start + Select  = Open Menu
Start = Close Menu (only while in menu)
L and R = switch menus

up down left right x = depends on menu by default menu 
controls are up and down to select option then left and right
will likely change the value on that selection still working
on dynamic menu handling.
